## Todo List for Fake Job Posting Detector Project

### Phase 1: Project setup and data collection
- [x] Create project directory structure
- [x] Research job boards and data scraping techniques
- [x] Find and utilize a publicly available job posting dataset

### Phase 2: Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- [x] Clean and preprocess raw job posting data
- [x] Extract relevant features for NLP models
- [x] Implement heuristic-based labeling for fake job postings

### Phase 3: Model development and training
- [x] Select and implement NLP models (BiLSTM, RoBERTa)
- [x] Train models on the labeled dataset
- [x] Fine-tune model hyperparameters

### Phase 4: Model evaluation and testing
- [x] Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
- [x] Test the model with unseen data
- [x] Analyze and interpret model results

### Phase 5: Application development and demonstration
- [x] Develop a user interface for the detector
- [x] Integrate the trained NLP model into the application
- [x] Create demonstration scenarios and output examples

### Phase 6: Documentation and final deliverables
- [x] Write comprehensive project documentation
- [x] Prepare a presentation for the internship submission
- [x] Package the complete code and resources
